        <h3> Exemplo 1</h3>
        
        <input id="op1" value="2"> <!-- creates an input field with the id "op1" and a default value of 2. This can be used to input the first operand of the addition operation. -->
        <span>+</span> <!-- is a text element that displays the "+" symbol, indicating an addition operation. -->
        <input id="op2" value="3"> <!-- creates another input field with the id "op2" and a default value of 3. This can be used to input the second operand of the addition operation. -->
        <span>=</span> <!-- is another text element that displays the "=" symbol, indicating that the result of the addition operation will follow. -->
        <input id="res" value=""> <!-- creates an input field with the id "res" and no default value. This can be used to display the result of the addition operation. -->

        <script src="dom.js"></script> <!-- includes a JavaScript file named "dom.js". This file presumably contains the JavaScript code that performs the addition operation when the form is submitted, and updates the "res" input field with the result.-->
